            What is the Dashboard?
          </p>
          <p id="answer">
            The dashboard is a collection of your pinned graphs from the "Graphs" page and allows for 
            quick access to these graphs. To remove a graph from your dashboard click the "x" symbol 
            on the top right of any graph.
          </p>
          <p id="question">
            How do I add new graphs to my dashboard?
          </p>
          <p id="answer">
            Navigate to the "Graphs" page and click the "+" symbol on the top right of any
            graph to append it to your dashboard.

          </p>
          <p id="question">
            How do I upload new data?
          </p>
          <p id="answer">
            Navigate to the "Upload Data" page and click the "Upload Data" button once you have completed
            the form. Upon successful data entry, your new data will be added to the database and all relevant 
            graphs will be updated automatically.
          </p>
          <p id="question">
            What filtering options are available on the "Graphs" page?
          </p>
          <p id="answer">
            Filters allow you to view graphs that match a certain criteria of data. The "Graphs" page has 
            two filter options: Data Type and Market. The two data types available to select from are Sales 
            and Attendance and the four markets available to select from are Ponce City Farmers Market, East 
            Atlanta Village Farmers Market, Decatur Farmers Market, and Grant Park Farmers Market.
